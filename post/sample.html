       This post is intended for non-data scientists and as such paints a simplified picture of the field.
    </h5>

      <div class="post_section_title"> Introduction </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        Whenever what I do for a living comes up, it’s usually met with one of the three following questions:
        <ol>
          <li>	What is that? </li>
          <li>	How did you get there? </li>
          <li>	How can I also do that? </li>
        </ol>
        The high number of repetitions in answering these questions led to the unintentional development of some form of a script. In this post, I wanted to do my best in creating a proper structure to the answers of these questions with the hope that this can be of assistance to any aspiring data scientists.
      </div>
      <div class="post_section_title"> What is Data Science? </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
      Data Science is the collection of various methods that enable the extraction of valuable insights from a data source. These methods are quite interdisciplinary, but are most heavily reliant on the fields of computer science and mathematics.
      <br>
      <br>
      The requirement of computer science knowledge is based on the necessity for the majority of data sources to be processed or “cleaned-up” before any insights can be extracted. Programming skills will allow you to interact with a database to obtain the data and also adjust it to a meaningful form which will result to you being more comfortable in generating that final valuable insight.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the data is brought into a meaningful form, some form of inference will usually be required to be made. That is where the expertise in mathematics becomes beneficial. Being able to confidently derive legitimate insights from a data source is a tricky business as it very easy to ignore some intricacies of the data which will lead to incorrect inferences. Mastering linear algebra for example, can become a great enabler for generating predictions.
      </div>
      <div class="post_section_title"> Sure, this sounds cool – but what is even the point? </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        Every business has always strived to improve their product, either through customer feedback or through meticulous note keeping of the business operations. Over the past few years, all industries have experienced a digital transformation which practically leads to, one – if not both – of the following two events:
        <ol>
        	 <li> The customer interacts with the business through a computer (e.g. Nike has an online shop). </li>
           <li> Business operations are run with the use of computers (e.g. Walmart running all supply chains through computers). </li>
      </ol>
        The outcome of both of these events is the automatic generation of data which can be equivalent to the customer feedback and operational note keeping of the good old days, in the sense that it can be used to improve the product. The only difference now is that the data is in a digital format and is significantly larger in quantity.
        <br>
        <br>
        That is where the data scientist, with the skillset that we went through before, comes in. Is the Nike customer that visited the website for 7 minutes and had a certain behavior likely to come back? Should I run a marketing campaign on that customer? What sort of email should I send to them? These are all questions that a Data Scientist can help answer. This is just scratching the surface of what a Data Scientist can do, but you get the point.
      </div>
      <div class="post_section_title"> What was my path? </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        Becoming a data scientist has not been my lifelong dream, the reality is far from it in fact. When I was 18, I decided to major in Economics and Finance with a (admittedly) vague plan to work in the finance industry upon graduation. In retrospective and perhaps slightly embarrassing so, this decision of mine was not based on what is materially important (interest in the subject, personality fit with day to day work etc), but on a pixelated image I had constructed in my head, probably through Hollywood productions, of what the life of a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/"> financier</a> looks like.
        <br>
        <br>
        In any case, after my first two years of studying the subject, I was offered the opportunity to work in a year-long internship for a well-known London based Hedge Fund. Needless to say, I was ecstatic and did not hesitate even for a minute to pause my studies and go experience “the dream”. While I was there and after the initial period of viewing everything through rose-colored glasses, I started comprehending the reality of the world of finance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Specifically, the perception I built was that it’s a highly condensed space with little to no meritocracy, mainly due to the fact that there is no concrete skill that would enable a merit-based evaluation. Also, the day to day operations in the world of finance is sub intellectually-stimulating, to put it mildly. Juniors in the industry usually take up menial tasks that serve the purpose of larger projects. To add to that, due to the fact that the space is very condensed, it necessarily takes more years than other industries to climb the ladder which means that the majority of juniors keep doing menial tasks for a significant amount of time.  I don’t mean to offend anyone working in the industry and I clarify that the image I described is only my perception – not necessarily the objective truth.
        <br>
        <br>
        My dissatisfaction in the early steps of my career acted as a strong forcing function for me to research alternative paths. I’ve always held a strong interest for Mathematics, and I remember at that time I was particularlhy keen to start getting involved with programming. As a result, when I came across Data Science as a potential path, I remember getting an instant rush of excitement. That was about halfway through my year-long internship, so I still had to “finish my time” in finance, but in any case, from that point on my focus was placed on only one thing, obtaining the necessary skills to become a data scientist. My day to day at work was heavily based on Excel so for the rest of that year I became very good at Excel VBA, the programming language of Excel. I also started interacting with some quants at the fund and picked up the basics of Python. My first learnings were based on a Python book which I actually don’t remember the name of (not particularly important as I would not recommend this path for learning Python – see below for my suggested path). Obviously, the time I could allocate to learning Python was necessarily limited to late nights after work and weekends, but I was fueled by this rush of excitement for this new potential that was ahead of me, so long hours was not even a consideration at the time.
        <br>
        <br>
        After I had learned the absolute bare minimum of Python, I started applying to any job on <a href="https://angel.co/jobs"> Angel.co</a> that would “hire” me to apply my skills. There were two spare months between the end of my finance internship and my last year at my undergraduate degree, so I thought I’ll put them in use by practicing these new skills. I did in fact manage to convince some poor startup founder that I could help him grow his business, but the reality ended up being far from it. My skillset was not even close to the level required to be productive so very little was actually accomplished that summer. In any case, it was a good addition to my CV, a steep learning curve in Python and a realization of what a chaos startup life may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        Upon the completion of this summer internship I returned for my final year of my undergrad. That year was a true grind (sorry social life) but has proven to be very rewarding. All of my elective courses were heavily focused on statistics and mathematics (e.g. econometrics, game theory etc) and I spent most of time working on extracurricular material, related to Data Science. I took a couple of Python courses on Coursera and completed the now acclaimed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a> course by Andrew Ng. As insightful and productive all that was, I found that by far the best way to solidify all this knowledge was to put it in practice. I’m a huge proponent of taking on projects on subjects of your own interest as your passion will propel you once the motivation dies out. That is why I created <a href="https://euroleageeks.wordpress.com/">Euroleageeks</a>, my blog that would house European basketball analytics projects. That was pretty great, had a lot of fun with it! On top of that, I managed to convince the Econ department at my university to allow me to work with a professor from the CS department for my dissertation which once again was related to Basketball Analytics. Huge thanks to the legend Antonio Mele for working his magic there to make this happen. As a side note, the level of my understanding of Machine Learning at the time was abysmal so my undergrad dissertation is not my proudest work. That said, it did move the needle in my skillset which in reality was the single objective, so I definitely do not regret it.
        <br>
        <br>
        The grind of my final undergrad year did materialize in a couple of very rewarding achievements as I got accepted for a postgrad in CS from a good engineering school in London and also got offered to intern in the analytics department of a major gaming company. The internship was a fantastic experience and I owe a lot to the team at Natural Motion (particular shout outs to Stefan Holmes and Zoe Burton, hope they’re doing well!). Following that, my master’s degree was definitely a tough year, but extremely beneficial in solidifying all the tangled-up self-taught learnings I had gathered over the past 18-24 months.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following my master’s degree, I definitely felt confident in taking on most junior Data Science jobs. I was lucky enough to join a great company named Palantir, where I’ve been able to make significant progress in my skillset. Shout out to Brady Fowler and Chris Martin for their huge support in progressing my skills in the field.

      <div class="post_section_title"> Suggested path </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        If what you read above has sparked your interest and you wish to pursue such a career, it’s never too late! Read my suggested path below for how you can get there:
        <br>
        <br>
        I will split this in two possible paths based on the maturity of one’s career:
        <ol>
          <li>	If you are reading this and you have not yet entered you are undergrad studies, I would highly recommend going for a double major in computer science and mathematics. Honestly, most will be taken care of semi-automatically from that point on, just make sure you do well in class. Some bonus suggestions: keep a neat GitHub account, start a blog and keep yourself busy with projects relevant to Data Science. Trust me, it will be highly valued when you start applying for jobs. Oh and apply for summer internships, they will go a long way!
          <li>	If you are not as lucky to be as young and free as the previous group, it might not be as easy, but that does not mean that you should be discouraged. The target here will likely be to achieve a level that makes you employable and be able to signal this, without being required to start your studies over. These are my suggested concrete steps in order to get there:
            <ol type="I">
              <li>	Learn how to code. Python is more than enough to get you a first job as a Data Scientist. My favorite online course for Python <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7?source=aw&awc=6798_1593333956_c168b57537e6a275b2d93e047eacb8e3&utm_source=aw&utm_medium=affiliate_partner&utm_content=text-link&utm_term=78888_Skimlinks">is this one, offered by MIT</a>. It is absolutely free and very popular amongst new Pythonistas. Note that this will take some time, maybe between 100-150 hours of dedicated time. </li>
              <li>	Get your maths straight. This is probably the trickiest part as you will never know how much is enough. I would say that the ultimate target here is to “graduate” from the Andrew Ng <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a> course with a full understanding of all material. I would probably recommend a few courses before you dabble with the Ng course, <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-inference-and-modeling?delta=0">these</a> <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-science-probability?delta=0">two<a> from Harvard should be good to do the job. </li>
              <li>	Put your learnings in practice. The importance of this is twofold:
                <ol>
                  <li>	It will solidify your learning and provide you with necessary confidence. </li>
                  <li>	This is how you will signal to employers that you are as good as anyone else out there – with or without a degree. You can either signal through blog posts that you create or by competing in public spots like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
       </ol>
        I guess you will have to take my word on this, but trust me, if you follow the above strategy, upon completion you will be skilled to get hired in any junior data science position. The demand for data scientists these days is ridiculously high so I’m very confident in saying that if you do this right, you will be hired fairly easily.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, do not and I repeat DO NOT expect that this will be easy. Programming especially can be extremely frustrating for beginners as the needle moves frustratingly slow. That said, there will at some point be an inflection point where you will not need to check your notes for every line you write and from that point on, your growth will become exponential – hang in there at least until you get there!
        <br>
        <br>
        I expect that this will take at the absolute best-case scenario 6 months, but realistically you are looking at about 12 months in order to fully absorb everything and properly put it into practice. What’s 12 months compared to a lifetime of happiness though?
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that a Data Scientist will never stop learning. My suggestions above are only going to get you to entry level but in order to reach the top, you will truly need to devote a significantly larger chunk of your time.
      </div>
      <div class="post_section_title"> What is the day to day like? </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        Data Science as a term may be used to describe a range of jobs between a Data Analyst and an ML engineer. What I will offer below is a generalization as the day to day might change depending on where on the range you stand exactly but it’s likely a decent representation of the field for the intended audience.
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>	Playing with the data (programming) will take up about 50-60% of your day. That’s isolation time, headphones on, just you and your mac (oh yes, you have to work on a mac). </li>
        <li>	Thinking about the problem and devising solutions to it will take about 20% of your time. That’s maths time, mainly. I find it’s usually best done in small groups, white boarding style. </li>
        <li>	The remaining of your day will likely be admin: emails, meeting etc., so you are looking at about ~25% of that. If you ask me that’s pretty good compared to other roles out there! </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="post_section_title"> Is it for everyone? </div>
      <div class="post_section_content">
        As described in detail above, a huge component of Data Science is mathematics which is a field that most, if not all people have at least dabbled with. If you felt that maths was not that fun for you, then Data Science is likely not going to be a great fit. In order to become a great Data Scientist you need to have an extremely good understanding of advanced topics in maths so if you feel that can never achieve that, you should probably find another field where you think you can absolutely excel.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for reading this post, I really hope it can be of assistance to you! If you do in fact follow the suggested path and you have any feedback, let me know and I’ll adjust for future readers. Good luck!
